# Data Structure Experiments

## Requirements

To build this program from source you'll need:

- g++ (C++ 17) and _make_
- Boost C++ Library (program_options module)
- clang-format (optional)

You can probably install them all using `sudo apt install build-essential libboost-all-dev clang-format`. You should also use the [Clang-Format VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xaver.clang-format) when using `clang-format`.
